## TL;DR

unclog is a zero-config, yet highly flexible logging library for C. It currently only supports POSIX-style OSes and needs pthread-style mutexes. CMake is used for building. 

There are plans to move from CMake to autotools OR add Windows support. Let's see.

### Compile and Install

make PREFIX=/usr/local install

## The Name

I googled nclog (for new C logging library) and got results for unclog. Seemed like a good name, and since its not far from unclog to uncle, *Bob's your unclog*.
